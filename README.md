Lucene-Index-Search-Example
===========================

This is a simple lucene index and search example.

Currently, the application is set to index files ending in ".java" which can be changed in the main method of SimpleFileIndexer.java
Several indexing files are then created.  Then using SimpleSearcher class, we search for "lucene" and list the file paths that match our query.
